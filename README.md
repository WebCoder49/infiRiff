# infi*Riff* - Music made by an AI
## Your Chance to Collaborate
**Infi*Riff*** is a project I, **WebCoder49**, have created, as I am a musician as well as a programmer and web developer. It was a very ambitious idea, so I decided to let the GitHub community **help and collaborate**!

## What is infi*Riff*?
infi*Riff* will be an **AI** project made of **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** which will **generate dance music for the client (user).** Infi*Riff* will work by **mixing together a melody, harmony, chords and a drum beat** to **create random music** while **still following the rules of music theory.** This means, if you are interested in / know much about **music, coding, music theory, dance music, Javascript, Web Development or OOP programming**, please *join in!*
